# Implementation of a depth-first search for a solution to the
# goat-wolf-cabbage puzzle.

# Problem: a man is transporting a goat, a wolf, and a cabbage. He
# must cross a river and has a boat that can only carry 1 item
# beside himself at a time. He cannot leave the goat alone on one
# side of the river with the cabbage because the goat will eat the
# cabbage. The same thing with the wolf and the goat. Find a sequence
# of actions that the man can execute to get everybody on the other
# side safely.
